Instructions to Build and execute the code :
-------------------------------------------
I. To run the program on EMR. 

	** Type aws configure in command prompt.

	** Set your Amazon credentials and default output format as json in prompted fields in command prompt as shown below:
		AWS Access Key ID : 
		AWS Secret Access Key : 
		Default region name : us-west-2
		Default output format : json

	** Upload the required Jar files of LinearRegression.java in the job folder of S3 bucket after compiling the JAVA file.
	** Make sure you have the input files uploaded in input folder in your bucket.
	** Replace '{bucket_name}' with your bucket name in lines 17,23,25,34 in Makefile.
	** Make sure HADOOP_CLASSPATH is set correctly before running any command.
		Command: export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=.:`hadoop classpath`

		1. Program Dependencies  
		   - Java 1.7
		   - hadoop-annotations-2.6.0.jar
		   - hadoop-common-2.6.0.jar
		   - hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.6.0.jar
		NOTE: Change the hadoop jars version in line 5 of Makefile, according to your machine before compiling the code.

		2. Commands to run:
			make clean
			make compile
			make run
			make split  
			make report

		3. Pre-requisite libraries to run RScript:
		   - R
		   - ggplot2
		   - rmarkdown  
		   - pandoc version 1.12.3 or higher

NOTE: If EMR is not working for you, try to check the parameters in Makefile, from line 16 to line 33.

II. Rscript will generate an output of linear regression in HTML and a PDF(plot.pdf) containing all the plots.

III. The final output is the report in PDF (located under README folder) which contains implementation details, output, conclusion and all the graphs showing linear fit that is generated by R script.
